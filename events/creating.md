* **Include resources** - Attach agendas, forms, or supporting documents
* **Use drafts** - Review before publishing to catch errors

## Tips for Effective Events

* **Be specific** - Include exact location, room numbers, parking info
* **Test virtual links** - Verify all meeting URLs work correctly
* **Set realistic times** - Allow enough time for the event
* **Add registration links** - If external registration is required
* **Include pricing early** - Help members plan to attend
* **Use conferences for multi-day** - Better organization than separate events

## Troubleshooting

### "Title is required" error
You must enter a title before saving or publishing.

### "End time must be after start time" error
Check that your end date and time are later than the start.

### "Virtual URL required" error
For virtual events, you must provide a meeting link.

### Image won't upload

* Ensure the image isn't too large
* Try selecting a different image

### Address autocomplete not working

* Try typing more of the address
* Manually enter the address if needed
