# Deleting Events

You can permanently delete events that you created or have permission to manage.

## Who Can Delete Events?

You can delete events if:

* You created the event
* You have management permissions at the event's scope level

## Before You Delete

⚠️ **Important**: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. When you delete an event:

* The event is removed from all member feeds
* Members can no longer view event details
* All associated images and attachments are deleted
* Interest count and view statistics are lost
* Members who expressed interest will lose that connection
* There is no way to recover a deleted event

## Deleting a Published Event

### From the Edit Screen

1. Open the event you want to delete
2. Tap the **edit icon** (pencil) to open the edit screen
3. Tap the **delete icon** (trash/bin icon) in the top-right corner
4. A confirmation dialog appears with the warning:
   * "Delete Event?"
   * "This action cannot be undone"
5. Review the warning message
6. Tap **Delete** to confirm, or **Cancel** to keep the event
7. A "Deleting event..." message appears
8. Once deleted, you return to the event list

### What Happens After Deletion

* The event is immediately removed from the system
* Members viewing the event will see it's no longer available
* You cannot undo this action
* The event disappears from your created events list
* Members who expressed interest are no longer connected to the event

## Deleting a Draft

You can also delete unpublished drafts:

1. Go to **My Drafts** from the drawer menu
2. Find the draft you want to delete
3. Open the draft
4. Tap the **delete icon** in the top-right corner
5. Confirm the deletion

See [Managing Drafts](../managing-drafts.md) for more information about draft management.

## Deleting Conference Events

For conferences with sessions:

### Deleting Individual Sessions

1. Open the conference event for editing
2. Scroll to the Conference Events section
3. Find the session you want to remove
4. Tap the **delete icon** on the session card
5. Confirm deletion
6. Tap **Update Event** to save changes

### Deleting Entire Conference

1. Open the conference event
2. Tap the edit icon
3. Tap the delete icon in the top-right
4. Confirm deletion
5. The conference and all its sessions are deleted

⚠️ **Warning**: Deleting a conference deletes all associated sessions as well.

## Alternatives to Deleting

Consider these options before permanently deleting:

### Keep as Past Event
Instead of deleting, let the event remain as a past event:
* Past events are automatically filtered from the main list
* Members can still reference details if needed
* Historical record is maintained

### Edit the Event
If information is outdated or incorrect:
* Edit the event with updated information
* Change dates, times, or location as needed
* Update description or virtual links

### Save as Draft
If you want to temporarily hide an event:
* This isn't directly supported for published events
* Consider updating the event with postponement information instead

## When to Delete

Delete events when:

* The event was created in error
* The event is permanently cancelled (consider editing to note cancellation instead)
* Duplicate events need to be removed
* Test events need to be cleaned up
* The event information is completely irrelevant

## Best Practices

* **Double-check** - Make sure you really want to delete before confirming
* **Communicate** - If deleting a published event, consider posting an announcement about cancellation
* **Save important info** - Copy any content you might need later before deleting
* **Consider editing** - For postponed or modified events, edit instead of delete
* **Clean up drafts** - Regularly delete unused drafts to stay organized

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the delete icon

* You may not have permission to delete this event
* You can only delete events you created or have management access to
* The delete icon appears in the edit screen, not the detail view

### Delete button is grayed out

* Check your internet connection
* Ensure you have proper permissions
* Try refreshing the app

### Accidentally deleted

Unfortunately, deleted events cannot be recovered. You will need to recreate the event if it was deleted by mistake.

### Conference won't delete

* Make sure you're deleting the main conference event, not just a session
* Verify your internet connection
* Try again in a few moments
