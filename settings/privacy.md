## Understanding Privacy Levels

### What "Hide" Means

When you hide information:

* ✅ **Hidden from**: Other members viewing your profile
* ✅ **Still visible to**: Administrators for organizational purposes
* ✅ **Still used for**: Internal communications if necessary

### What Remains Visible

Even with privacy settings enabled, these remain visible:

* Your name
* Your chapter affiliation
* Your membership status
* Your profile photo
* Information you've shared in public posts or comments

## Privacy Best Practices

### Recommended Settings for Privacy-Conscious Members

Consider enabling:
* Hide Mobile Phone Number
* Hide Home Phone Number
* Hide Mailing Address
* Hide Email Address
* Hide Emergency Contact

Leave visible:
* Date of Birth (for birthday wishes from brothers)

### Balanced Privacy Settings

For those who want some privacy but also connectivity:
* Hide Mailing Address
* Hide Emergency Contact
* Leave phone and email visible for easier connection

### Open Profile Settings

For maximum connectivity with brothers:
* Leave all settings disabled (default)
* All information remains visible
* Easier for brothers to contact you

## Security Information

### How Your Data Is Protected

**Secure Storage:**
* Your credentials are encrypted on your device
* Industry-standard security practices
* Regular security updates

**Privacy First:**
* Biometric data never leaves your device
* Profile visibility you control
* You choose what to share

**Anonymous Analytics:**
* User identity anonymized using SHA-256 hashing
* Only aggregated usage patterns collected
* No personal information in analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Changes not saving

* Check your internet connection
* Wait a moment and try again
* Look for error messages on screen
* Restart the app and try again

### Information still visible to others

* Settings may take a moment to propagate
* Ask another member to refresh your profile
* Ensure you toggled the correct setting
* Verify you saw a confirmation message

### Want to unhide information

* Simply toggle the setting back off
* Information becomes visible immediately
* No penalty for changing settings frequently

### Analytics toggle not working

* Check your internet connection
* Restart the app and try again
* Changes should take effect immediately

## Important Notes

### Profile Updates

Remember that hiding information doesn't delete it from your profile. See [Editing Your Profile](../profile/editing-profile.md) to update or remove information entirely.

### Communication

Even with contact information hidden, administrators can still reach you if necessary for organizational purposes.

### Reversible

All privacy settings are completely reversible. You can show or hide information at any time.

### Other Features

Privacy settings only control profile visibility. They don't affect:
* Your ability to view other profiles
* Announcements you receive
* Events you can see
