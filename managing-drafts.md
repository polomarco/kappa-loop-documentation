# Managing Drafts

Drafts allow you to save announcements without publishing them immediately. You can edit, review, and publish drafts when ready.

## What Are Drafts?

Drafts are unpublished announcements that:

* Are saved to your account
* Can be edited multiple times
* Are not visible to other members
* Can be published at any time
* Remain available until you delete them or publish them

## Accessing Your Drafts

1. Tap the **menu icon** (â˜°) in the top-left corner
2. Select **My Drafts** from the drawer menu
3. The drafts screen opens with your unpublished content

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: The "My Drafts" option only appears if you have announcement or event creation permissions.

## Draft Tabs

The drafts screen has three tabs:

* **All** - Shows both announcement and event drafts
* **Announcements** - Shows announcement drafts only
* **Events** - Shows event drafts only

Tap any tab to filter your drafts by type.

## Viewing Your Drafts

Each draft card displays:

* **Title** - The announcement headline
* **Content Preview** - First few lines of the content
* **Creation Date** - When you created the draft
* **Scope Badge** - Shows Grand Chapter, Province, or Chapter level
* **Metadata** - Expiration date and pin status (if set)

## Working with Drafts

### Opening a Draft

Tap any draft card to open it in the edit screen.

### Editing a Draft

1. Open the draft from the drafts screen
2. Make your changes:
   * Update title or content
   * Add or remove images
   * Attach or remove files
   * Change metadata (pin status, expiration)
3. Tap **Save Draft** to keep it unpublished
4. Or tap **Publish** to make it live

### Publishing a Draft

To publish a draft and make it visible to members:

**Option 1: From the Draft Edit Screen**
1. Open the draft
2. Review all content
3. Tap the **Publish** button at the bottom
4. The draft becomes a published announcement

**Option 2: Quick Publish**
1. From the drafts list, some interfaces may show a publish button
2. Tap to publish directly
3. Confirm if prompted

Once published:
* The announcement appears in member feeds immediately
* The draft is removed from your drafts list
* Members at the appropriate scope level can view it
* A `publishedAt` timestamp is set

### Deleting a Draft

To permanently remove a draft:

1. Open the draft from the drafts screen
2. Tap the **delete icon** (trash/bin) in the top-right corner
3. Confirm the deletion
4. The draft is permanently removed

See [Deleting Announcements](deleting.md) for more information.

## Creating New Drafts

To save an announcement as a draft:

1. Create a new announcement (see [Creating Announcements](creating.md))
2. Fill in the required fields (title and content)
3. Optionally add images, files, and metadata
4. Tap **Save Draft** instead of Publish
5. The announcement saves to your drafts

## Draft Organization

Drafts are organized by:

* **Creation date** - Newest drafts appear first
* **Scope type** - Filtered by where they'll be published
* **Content type** - Separated into announcements and events

## When to Use Drafts

Drafts are useful when you want to:

* **Prepare content in advance** - Write announcements before you're ready to publish
* **Review before posting** - Take time to proofread and refine
* **Collaborate** - Work on content over multiple sessions
* **Schedule mentally** - Create now, publish later when timing is right
* **Save incomplete work** - Come back to finish later

## Best Practices

* **Regular cleanup** - Delete old drafts you no longer need
* **Clear naming** - Use descriptive titles to easily identify drafts
* **Review before publishing** - Always double-check content before making it live
* **Set reminders** - Don't let important drafts sit too long unpublished
* **Use drafts for templates** - Save common announcement formats as drafts

## Draft Limitations

* **Drafts are private** - Only you can see your drafts
* **Not collaborative** - Multiple people cannot edit the same draft
* **No auto-publish** - Drafts must be manually published (no scheduling feature)
* **No notifications** - Members don't know you have unpublished drafts

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find my draft

* Check that you're on the correct tab (All, Announcements, or Events)
* Verify the scope level matches where you created the draft
* Ensure you didn't accidentally publish or delete it

### Draft won't save

* Check that title and content are not empty
* Verify your internet connection
* Try again in a few moments

### Lost changes to a draft

* Always tap Save Draft before leaving the edit screen
* Changes are not automatically saved
* If you navigated away without saving, changes may be lost

### Draft disappeared after publishing

This is normal behavior - once published, the draft is removed from your drafts list and becomes a published announcement. You can find it in the main announcements feed.
