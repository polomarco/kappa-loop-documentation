See [Managing Drafts](../managing-drafts.md) for more information.

## What Happens When You Edit?

* **Published announcements** - Changes are immediately visible to all members
* **Drafts** - Changes are saved but remain unpublished
* **Modification timestamp** - Updated to show when last edited
* **View count** - Preserved (not reset)
* **Existing attachments** - Preserved unless you remove them

## Best Practices for Editing

* **Review before saving** - Double-check your changes
* **Add a note** - If making significant changes, consider adding a note in the content
* **Update expiration** - Extend the date if the announcement remains relevant
* **Check links** - Verify all links still work after editing
* **Test attachments** - Make sure new attachments uploaded correctly

## Tips

* **Minor edits** - Fix typos and update information as needed
* **Major changes** - Consider creating a new announcement instead of heavily editing
* **Save often** - Drafts auto-save your changes
* **Preview** - Review the full announcement before publishing edits

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the edit icon

* You may not have permission to edit this announcement
* You can only edit announcements you created or have management access to

### Changes aren't saving

* Check your internet connection
* Ensure title and content aren't empty
* Try again in a few moments

### Lost my changes

* If you navigated away, changes may not have been saved
* Always tap Save before leaving the edit screen
