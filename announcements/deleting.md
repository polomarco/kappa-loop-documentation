# Deleting Announcements

You can permanently delete announcements that you created or have permission to manage.

## Who Can Delete Announcements?

You can delete announcements if:

* You created the announcement
* You have management permissions at the announcement's scope level

## Before You Delete

⚠️ **Important**: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. When you delete an announcement:

* The announcement is removed from all member feeds
* All associated images and attachments are deleted
* View count and statistics are lost
* Members can no longer access the content
* There is no way to recover a deleted announcement

## Deleting a Published Announcement

### From the Edit Screen

1. Open the announcement you want to delete
2. Tap the **edit icon** to open the edit screen
3. Tap the **delete icon** (trash/bin icon) in the top-right corner
4. A confirmation dialog appears
5. Review the warning message
6. Tap **Delete** to confirm, or **Cancel** to keep the announcement
7. Once deleted, you return to the previous screen

### What Happens After Deletion

* The announcement is immediately removed from the system
* Members viewing the announcement will see it's no longer available
* You cannot undo this action
* The announcement disappears from your created announcements list

## Deleting a Draft

You can also delete unpublished drafts:

1. Go to **My Drafts** from the drawer menu
2. Find the draft you want to delete
3. Open the draft
4. Tap the **delete icon** in the top-right corner
5. Confirm the deletion

See [Managing Drafts](../managing-drafts.md) for more information about draft management.

## Alternatives to Deleting

Consider these options before permanently deleting:

### Set an Expiration Date
Instead of deleting, set the announcement to expire:
* Edit the announcement
* Add an expiration date
* The announcement automatically stops displaying after that date
* You can still access it later if needed

### Unpin the Announcement
If you just want to reduce visibility:
* Edit the announcement
* Toggle off the "Pin Announcement" option
* The announcement moves to regular chronological order

### Create a Corrected Version
If information is outdated or incorrect:
* Create a new announcement with updated information
* Reference or explain the changes
* Delete the old announcement if necessary

## When to Delete

Delete announcements when:

* Information is completely outdated or irrelevant
* The announcement was created in error
* Content violates policies or guidelines
* You're consolidating multiple announcements into one
* The announcement is causing confusion

## Best Practices

* **Double-check** - Make sure you really want to delete before confirming
* **Save important info** - Copy any content you might need later
* **Consider expiration** - Use expiration dates instead of immediate deletion when appropriate
* **Communicate changes** - If deleting important information, consider posting an updated announcement
* **Clean up drafts** - Regularly delete unused drafts to stay organized

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the delete icon

* You may not have permission to delete this announcement
* You can only delete announcements you created or have management access to

### Delete button is grayed out

* Check your internet connection
* Ensure you have proper permissions
* Try refreshing the app

### Accidentally deleted

Unfortunately, deleted announcements cannot be recovered. You will need to recreate the announcement if it was deleted by mistake.
